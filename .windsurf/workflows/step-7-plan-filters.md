auto_execution_mode: 1

Task:
Check if filters are already implemented in the backend and design an implementation plan in React to use them.

Instructions:
	1.	Verify Backend
USE THE MongoDB MCP to search in the database and understand the schema if necessary
	•	Confirm if filters already exist in the backend.
	•	Identify which endpoint(s) allow property filtering and what parameters they accept (e.g. location, type, bedrooms, price, amenities).
	•	Document the data model that the backend returns.
	2.	React Integration Plan
	•	Define which filters will be available in the UI.
	•	Establish how each filter will connect with the endpoint parameters.
	•	Describe the necessary state structure (e.g. selected filters, filtered results).
	•	Define how results are updated when applying or clearing filters.

	3.	Implementation Plan by Phases

	4.	MD File
	•	Generate a .md file with clear sections:
	•	Backend (endpoints and available parameters)
	•	Expected data model
	•	React integration plan
	•	Implementation steps (high level)
	•	Next steps

Expected Format:
A short, clear document, without code examples, that shows the complete plan at a glance.
